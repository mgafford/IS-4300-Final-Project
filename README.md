# IS-4300-Final-Project

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.


The date has the following columns nameas and what they mean:
Attribute inforamtion:
age: The person's age in years
sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)
trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)
ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)
thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)
